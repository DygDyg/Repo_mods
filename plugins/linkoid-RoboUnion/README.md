# Robo Union
Protecting Semibot Rights Since 2024

## About
Allows more players to play at once by providing options for adjusting the maximum number of players in a room.

Only the Host needs to have RoboUnion installed.

Works with REPO v0.1.2 and v0.1.2.22_beta

## Troubleshooting and Debugging
If the configured player limit is greater than the max players permitted by the servers,
an error message will be displayed and the player cap will automatically be adjusted for that session.

You may encounter stability issues with a large number of players.
Some debug tools for viewing network traffic are provided in the config.
Technical users may use these tools to test for and remove mods that may cause increased traffic,
leading to instability.
